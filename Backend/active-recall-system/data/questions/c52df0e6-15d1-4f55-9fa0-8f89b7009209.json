  "question": "What characterizes the color of light according to its wavelength?",
  "explanation": "The color of light is characterized by its wavelength, as it is an electromagnetic wave. Different wavelengths of light correspond to different colors; for instance, light with shorter wavelengths tends to be perceived as blue, while longer wavelengths are associated with red. Therefore, the wavelength content of light is the primary factor that dictates what color we perceive it to be.",
