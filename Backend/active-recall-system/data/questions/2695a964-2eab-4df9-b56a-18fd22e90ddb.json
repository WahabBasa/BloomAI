  "question": "What are the visible wavelengths detected by humans, and what colors correspond to short and long wavelengths?",
  "explanation": "The visible wavelengths that humans can detect range from approximately 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm. In this range, short wavelengths (around 400 nm) produce a blue sensation, whereas long wavelengths (around 700 nm) produce a red sensation. This means that the human visual system is sensitive to a spectrum of light defined between these limits, with color perception varying according to these wavelengths.",

  "userAnswer": "between 300 and 400",
